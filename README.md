Ecommerce Clothing Search with Live Results (Vue.js & Tailwind CSS)
This project demonstrates a front-end implementation for an e-commerce clothing website with a live search bar. Users can find relevant clothing items as they type in the search bar, with results displayed dynamically without needing to press an "Enter" button.
